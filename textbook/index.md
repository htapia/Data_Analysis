# Data Analysis
## Analisis de Datos

### By Horacio Tapia-McClung

## Description 

An introduction data analysis with an emphasis on modern physics. A data-driven approach to study complex systems. 

## Additional Readings 

* **[Learning Data Science]** (https://learningds.org/intro.html) "is an introductory textbook for data science published that covers foundational skills in programming and statistics that encompass the data science lifecycle".
* **[Principles and Techniques of Data Science]** [The Berkeley data science course](https://ds100.org/). Free online.
* **[Think]** [Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html), Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey. Free online book.

## Computing Requirements

* You should have acces to a computer, ideally a laptop, configured with your favorite programming environment. I suggest Python [via Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/), [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) or MATLAB(https://mathworks.com/). 

* See the official [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#) to get started using notebooks. Here is a good [keyboard shortcut cheat sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/pdf_bw/), here is a [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet), and here are details of how to write [mathematics using LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

* [MATLAB is free](https://www.uv.mx/mathworks/) for UV students and academics so go and learn how to use it!
  
* If you want to install [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)  contact me.
